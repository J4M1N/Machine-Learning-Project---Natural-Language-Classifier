Machine Learning Project - Natural Language Classifier

Objectives
- Build a machine learning project which combines a simple classifier with a language model
- Understand how to use a pre-trained language model in a machine learning project
- Create a professional, production-ready machine learning application
- Ensure your README.md is well-structured and informative

Overview

Summary
- You're going to use everything you've learned so far to build a full AI pipeline. You will:

    - Choose a real-world dataset from a curated list
    - Ingest and store that data reliably, using a local script which will form the basis for an AWS Lambda with RDS
    - Train a model on that data to understand or generate insights
    - Create a chatbot interface that uses your trained model
    - Add RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality using simple local files
    - Throughout, you will polish this up to a professional standard, ensuring your README is constantly updated and that this project can form a key     part of your portfolio.

Note: The final task involves getting feedback, reflecting on your work, and polishing up the project so it's perfect for your portfolio. Even if you don't finish all the technical tasks, make sure you skip ahead to the final task as the project time nears the end.

    abstract = "Emotions are expressed in nuanced ways, which varies by collective or individual experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.",
